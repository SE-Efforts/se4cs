Breaking the Build #

If any of the commands in the first four stages returns a non-zero exit code, Travis CI considers the build to be broken.

When any of the steps in the before_install, install or before_script stages fails with a non-zero exit code, the build is marked as errored.

When any of the steps in the script stage fails with a non-zero exit code, the build is marked as failed.

Note that the script section has different semantics to the other steps. When a step defined in script fails, the build doesnâ€™t end right away, it continues to run the remaining steps before it fails the build.

Currently, neither the after_success nor after_failure have any influence on the build result. We have plans to change this behaviour

before_install -> errored
install -> errored
before_script  -> errored
script -> failed
after_success or after_failure
after_script
OPTIONAL before_deploy
OPTIONAL deploy
OPTIONAL after_deploy
